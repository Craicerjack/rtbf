# The Data behind the European Privacy Transparency Report

## Where the data is coming from

Google's Transparency Report for [European privacy requests for search removals](http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/?hl=en) visualises the number of request and share of removed and not removed URLs by country. The [source code](view-source:http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/?hl=en) of the website contains this data in JSON format (jeep, the html, I know...).

Until March this year the source code actually contained a little more: There was a break-down of requests and URLs respectively into different *issue types*: *cp* , *private_personal_info*, *political*, *public_figure*, *serious_crime* - and Google's decision within each of these categories.
This page illustrates the main take-aways from the data. An article I did together with [**CORRECT!V**](https://correctiv.org/blog/2015/07/13/recht-auf-vergessen/) and Julia Powles from the **The Guardian** explains why this data-discovery is important in the context of the heated debate around the Right to be Forgotten.

## What is the aim of this website

The Right to be Forgotten affects all citizens in Europe, both on the side of the requesting individual with an interest in privacy as well as the person doing a web search with an interest in information. The Right to be Forgotten ruling and its impact on how we see the internet has been discussed very differently in different countries in Europe for there are cultural differences of course but language is a barrier, too. Data and statistics however are universal. I would like to stimulate a meaningful and fact-based discussion around the Right to be Forgotten and Online Privacy in general and hope this page can contribute its part to it. 

## What you can do

To help spread the facts to all European Countries, you can help me translate the bits of text on this page. Just for the source code on Github, add a new index_<your_language>.html (i.e. *index_fr.html*), copy the index.html and amend the bits of text around the Graphics into your language. You don't need to make a literal translation, feel free to write about the findings from the data people from your country will find important! 

I am also interested to research this topic further, so please do get in touch, via Github or Twitter [@sytpp](https://twitter.com/sytpp) or via my [homepage](http://sytpp.github.io/).
